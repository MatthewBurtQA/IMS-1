# IMS
An inventory management system for the adeptus ministorum, holding data on wargear, clients and their orders. 
contains ERD within the slideshow.

### Unit Tests 

Unit test currently just for customer related matters, run JUnit within the application. 

### And coding style tests
Check sonarqube, and look for code smells. I had many at first but they've been trimmed down quite rapidly.
